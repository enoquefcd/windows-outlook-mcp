# Outlook MCP Server

This is a unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for comprehensive Microsoft Outlook integration. It operates the local Outlook client on Windows via COM and PowerShell, providing both **email management** and **calendar management** features. Its main advantage is fast deployment on Windows without complex security authentication.



## Installation

### 0. System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Microsoft Outlook installed and configured
- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- 
### 1. Install dependencies
```powershell
cd path\to\windows-outlook-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Compile TypeScript
```powershell
npm run build
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop
Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path\\to\\windows-outlook-mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

#### Create an out-of-office event
```
Create a vacation event from 2025-12-24 to 2025-12-31 marked as OutOfOffice.
```

#### Find free time slots
```
Find free 30-minute slots in my calendar for next week between 9 AM and 5 PM.
```



## Using from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

The MCP server runs on Windows (requires the Outlook COM interface), but Claude Code
runs inside WSL. Bridge them by pointing the WSL Claude config at the Windows Node
binary and the Windows dist path.

### Claude Code config (`~/.claude.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\windows-outlook-mcp\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Use the Windows `node.exe` via `/mnt/c/...` — do **not** use the WSL
> Node binary. The server spawns PowerShell COM calls that only work from a Windows
> process. The WSL path `/mnt/c/...` is transparent to Windows Node.

### Build from WSL

You can edit source in WSL and build via the Windows npm:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/<your-username>/windows-outlook-mcp
/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm.cmd run build
```

Or open a PowerShell terminal on the Windows side and run `npm run build` there.
